# Project

Brief explanation of work so far:

* Data: Folder with both texts
* Simple_model.ipynb: Contains cleaning scripts for both texts and 2 simple cosine similairty models. The first one is a basic cosine similairty, the second one applies bert transformers on the vectors then gets cosine similarity.
